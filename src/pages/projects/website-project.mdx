# Congratulations...
...You have found the very first post on this website! I like to think that you are an employer of a big company that just binge read my whole blog page and arrived at the end, but chances are, that you are 'just' a friend i bragged to about this website :). 

Let's be real here. It is unlikely, that this page will reach people outside of my social circle. So for the time being, this serves as a creative outlet. My little place in the internet, where i get to share about whacky discoveries in data, statistics, computer science, design and everything inbetween.

## Goal of this website
I destinguish between three groups of people, that this project is aimed at:
1. **Employers an headhunters**
    
    If you are an employer, you most likely have little time to go through an application. Reading endless coverletters, checking CVs for hardskills and scrolling through github stats and repositories will likely feel boring and repetitive at some point. This project is supposed to bring you not only a breath of fresh air but also provide you with what you want to know as fast as possible: **Is this applicant capable of not only applying abstract concepts but also find utility in them? Is he able to communicate his findings in an accurate and consise way, such that people with little to no background still get something out of it?**

2. **Other students**

    I believe in sharing and discussing the things we learn. This mindset has been a big driver in making everything i do reuseable and accessable. Previously my work has been shared through GitHub and DMs. I hope this website will make it easier to access coursework and ultimatively will benefit all of us.
  
3. **Anybody working in the field**

    Because this website is very fast and designed for mobile devices, it can be quickly webbed into social interactions. This way, i can get quick feedback for my work and find ways to improve.


## Design process and decisions
Keeping these core-audiences in mind, i came up with some key decisions. Here are some of them:

### Design first then build
With this project i wanted to plan before i build. So i used Figma to get a feel for the structure and design of the site. It also allowed me to experiment with UI elements without needing to think about the technical details. Figm also encouraged me to devide the page into usefull components beforehand and use prototyping. If you look into the [figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/wa1hqL0V08QNj4ApCAi279/Porfolio-Website?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=15VC8akG3FDrw6zz-1), you will find structure components, that layout the general div-structure of components with display and positon properties.

### Typography
I decided to use a lot of monospace, because of its typical association with `code`. From the headerlogo to the headings in the landingpages of [notes](/notesLanding) and [projects](/projectsLanding) i wanted to find the a right balance between making every coder feel home and not blatantly overdoing it.

I also didn't want to spend a lot time searching for fancy fonts, as this is not a website for a webdesigner. For everything else i stuck to **Roboto Flex** and tailwinds default **Helvetica**.

### Color
At first i heavily leaned on the content first approach, inspired by instagram. This meant a simple headerbar with no color and mostly grayscale in the UI.

But after a while i realized, that i could use color to pick up the viewers attention and guide the eye from there. Take the homescreen for example:
![Eye guide](/portfolio-website/src/assets/Projects/website/eyeguide.png)

The vibrant orange and pink demand the viewers attention and the gaussian pdf leads the viewers eye to the navigation cards. Intuitively the viewer knows what this website is about and provides you with navigational options afterwards.

I chose *orange* and *pink*, because orange symbolizes *energy and change*, while pink is typically associated with *creativity and innovation*. Coloruse is consistent throughout the project and is a part of the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Framework
I wanted a site, that would load very quickly, a responsive design and a simple and effective workspace. With Astro and Tailwind i had everything i needed. Astro reduces the javascript footprint and prebuilds the pages at build time, which results in excellent loading times. It also supports markdown files, which makes it very easy to create blog pages.

Tailwind is pretty much the go to for many professional webdevelopers. It is fast, easy to use and reduces the amount of css shipped in the final page, further contributing to loading-speed.
